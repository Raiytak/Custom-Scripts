For all the music lovers, if you have downloaded many musics using Youtube for example, this script changes their album's name of your .mp3!
The album's name is generated by the script using the directoy's name or you can provide it manually.


## Installation

python => 3.8 necessary (see https://www.python.org/downloads/)
```
git clone https://github.com/Raiytak/Custom-Scripts.git
cd Custom-Scripts
cd change_album
pip install
```

You can now launch the script by typing ```python -m change_album```
Add ```--help``` to see the possible options!
